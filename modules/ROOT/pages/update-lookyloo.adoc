= Update Lookyloo

[IMPORTANT]
====
It assumes you installed lookyloo with the procedure describe on this website.

== Update lookyloo

The recommended way to update Lookyloo is to run the following command, from the directory you cloned lookyloo into:

```bash
poetry run update
```

It will do the following (you can stop at any point if you hit `n`):

1. Pull the lookyloo repository.

   **Note**: if the update script is modified by the pull, the script will stop
             and you will be asked to re-run it.

2. Make sure the version of poetry you're using is recent enough.
3. Install the right version of the dependencies.
4. Validate the current status of the configuration files.
5. Update the configuration files with the default values from the sample file (if missing).
6. Pull the expected version of the 3rd party javascript dependencies.
7. Restart the website and the other scripts.
