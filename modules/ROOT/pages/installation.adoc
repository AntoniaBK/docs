[id="installation"]

= Before You Begin


The install guide assumes that you will be running Lookyloo on a unix based system,
preferably Ubuntu 20.04 or more recent.
It is also assumed that the user with whom you will proceed to the installation is a sudoer.

There are a few different methods to install Lookyloo:

* xref:install-lookyloo.adoc[Single-user], on your computer
* xref:install-lookyloo-production.adoc[Multi-user], on a server
* xref:install-lookyloo-docker.adoc[Fully dockerized]

[NOTE]
  There will be a usable docker based install guide soon, but the configuration
  files aren't fully funtional yet.
