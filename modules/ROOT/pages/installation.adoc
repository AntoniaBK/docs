[id="installation"]

= Before You Begin

The install guide assumes that you will be running Lookyloo on a Unix based system,
preferably link:https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/[Ubuntu 20.04] or a more recent version.
You can however xref=prerequisites-for-windows.adoc[configure a Linux Subsystem on Windows] in order to make Lookyloo work without having to switch to another operating system.
It is also assumed that the user proceeding with the installation is a sudoer.

You can install Lookyloo using a method that best suits your needs:

* xref:install-lookyloo.adoc[Single-user], on your computer
* xref:install-lookyloo-production.adoc[Multi-user], on a server
* xref:install-lookyloo-docker.adoc[Fully dockerized]

[NOTE]
  Currently, the configuration files for Lookyloo on Docker are not fully functional. A usable Docker-based           install guide will be available soon.
