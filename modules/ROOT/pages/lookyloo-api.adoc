In order to use Lookyloo, you can also use the application programming interface (API)
and trigger all kind of actions in the applications.

The two main approaches are the following:

* xref:lookyloo-pylookyloo.adoc[Pylookyloo], either via the command line, or as a python library (easy)
* xref:lookyloo-rest.adoc[REST queries], using something like cURL, or your own favorite programming language (slightly more complicated)
