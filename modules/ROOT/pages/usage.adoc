= Usage

== Before You Begin

Before you start using lookyloo, you should be familiar with a few xref:concepts.adoc[concepts],
otherwise it won't make much sense.

== How to use Lookyloo

To learn more about using Lookyloo read through our documentation.

== Capture a website

This is the entry point when you want to investigate a website.

image::capture.png[Capture form]

=== URL

The only required field is the **URL**, which is the URL you want to capture. It might be the
index page of the domain to capture:

* link:example.com[example.com])

Or a more complete URL:

* link:https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved[https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved]

=== Referer

The link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer[referer] is optional but it must be a full URL if you want to use it.

Usecase: some websites block requests if they're not initiated by an internal URL. If that's the case, pass the required URL in the referer field.

Note: It may not be enough and the wensite may also require a cookie. If it is the case, see below.

=== Cookies

It will be empty by default, but please refer to the related documentaiton in order to
initiate a new capture with xref:capture-cookies.adoc[a pre-refined cookie].

=== Browser configuration

By default, lookyloo passes a relatively comon user-agent when it captures a page.
You can change it by picking the type of operating system and the browser type in the dropdown boxes.
The user-agent used in the one in the last dropdown menu (this one will be used by default).

You can also pass the user-agent of your own browser by ticking the box.

Note: If your browser has a very special user-agent, it may leak information about you.

Note: If you want to pass a very specific user-agent for the capture, you can change your
      user-agent in the parameters of your browser and reload the page.

=== Depth

It is not enabled by default because it will most of the time take too long on most websites. The default depth is 1 (capture only the given URL).

If you enable the feature, a value of 2 will capture the given URL, extract all the links in the page, pick all the ones with the same hostname as the
initial URL, and capture them. As you can imagine, it may get huge very fast.

== Investigate a capture

As a general statement, if something in unclear, you should **move your mouse over** the part of the section that doesn't make sense,
and it should display a text giving some explanations. If it doesn't, please link:https://github.com/Lookyloo/lookyloo#support[get in touch with us],
or keep reading this page.

=== Nodes

Simple example with the initial URL `github.com`.

image:node1.png[landing page github]

* The node with a thumbnail of the screenshot is the page as it would be displayed in your browser (after all the redirects).
  Click on the image to see the screenshot fullscreen.
* This node contians one single URL, the content of the response is an HTML page
* The response from the server has 3 cookies

image:node2.png[redirect]

* In order to get to the landing page, we went from a unencrypted URL (http) to an encrypted one (https)
* The initial response was empty, it generally means that the redirect was made by the server directly (3XX HTTP code)

image:node3.png[ressources on the page]

* The landing page loads ressources from two differnt hostnames (`github.githubassets.com` and `avatars.githubusercontent.com`)
* 113 resources are loaded from `github.githubassets.com` (9 javascript, 4 CSS, 80 images, 6 videos)
* 24 ressources are loaded from `avatars.githubusercontent.com` (all images)

image:node4.png[ressources in ressources]

* some of the URLs in the node `github.githubassets.com` are themselves loading content from URLs on `github.githubassets.com` (8 fonts).
  It will most probably come from the CSS in the parent node.

In order to investigate it further, we can click on each of the hostnames and open an investigation popup, more on that below.

=== Hostnode popup

Clicking on the first node `github.githubassets.com` opens the following pop-up:

image:investigation1.png[investigation popup]

* You will see every URL aggregated in that node
* You can do a lot of things from there:
  - Get every ressource loaded from the server
  - See if they are present in other captures (correlation by hash)
  - See the HTTP status code of the response
  - Download all the URLs and hashes
  - Get the cookies received of sent for each HTTP request
  - Copy individual URLs
  - If you put pur mouse over the image icon, it will display the image
