= Scrape Cookies

If you want to scrape a website as if you were loggged in, you need to pass your sessions cookies.

You can do it the the following way:


. Install link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-quick-manager/[Cookie Quick Manager].
. Click on the icon in the top right of your browser > Manage all cookies
. Search for a domain and tick the Sub-domain box if needed
. Right clock on the domain you want to export > save to file > $LOOKYLOO_HOME/cookies.json

You will need to restart the webserver. After restart, every cookie you have in that file will be available for the browser used by Splash.
