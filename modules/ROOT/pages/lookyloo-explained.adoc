= What is Lookyloo?

With Lookyloo you can view the anatomy of connections within a webpage. 

Lookyloo is a web interface that allows you to scrape a website and then display a tree of domains that call each other (as related to a particular website page).

Use Lookyloo to map the journey a website page takes - from its intial URL address to the various redirects to third-party affiliations. You can parse the data from the web scrape to get a better understanding of what and who has access to information you may be unwittingly sharing.
